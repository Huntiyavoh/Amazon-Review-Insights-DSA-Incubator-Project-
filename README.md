# Amazon-Review-Insights-DSA-Incubator-Project-
This project analyzes Amazon product reviews, pricing, and discounts using Excel. I cleaned and transformed the data, shortened product names and categories, and built pivot tables and a dashboard to highlight trends and key insights.
Dataset Description

# Dataset descripton
	•	Product details: Name, category, price, discount, and ratings
	•	Customer engagement: Review titles, content, and reviewer counts
	•	Size: 1,465 records × 16 columns
	•	Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data in comma-separated values

# Tasks and Solutions

I cleaned and transformed the data using Power BI tools in Excel (Power Query), shortened long product names and categories using delimiters, and removed unnecessary data. I then built pivot tables and calculated columns to answer key business questions:

✅ Average discount % by category
✅ Count of products per category
✅ Total reviews per category
✅ Products with highest average ratings
✅ Avg actual vs discounted price by category
✅ Products with highest review counts
✅ Count of products with ≥50% discount
✅ Product rating distribution
✅ Potential revenue (actual price × rating count) per category
✅ Unique products by price bucket
✅ Relationship between discount level and rating
✅ Products with <1,000 reviews
✅ Categories with highest discounts
✅ Top 5 products by rating + review count

➡ The final output includes a cleaned dataset, pivot table summaries, and an Excel dashboard showcasing insights on product performance, pdd ricing, discounts, and customer feedback.
